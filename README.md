Dive Inside Object-oriented Python
======================

This repository contains code used during my Object-oriented Python workshop.

You need [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to run the notebooks. To install it see the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

For Linux and Mac systems you just have to create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are not following the workshop you can find a series of posts that discuss the same topics [on my blog](https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2014/08/20/python-3-oop-part-1-objects-and-types/)

The workshop is divided into the following sections

1. Intro and discussion about OOP
2. Objects
3. Classes
4. Instances
5. Delegation
6. Polymorphism

Each of the sections 2-6 has one companion notebook with exercises and one with the solutions. I highly recommed that you try to solve the exercises before looking at the solutions. No effort, no results! =)
